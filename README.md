# Hi, I’m Felix 👋🏼

🎓 I’m studying Technical Informatics at OTH Regensburg.

🛠️ I focus on embedded systems, IoT, and backend development. I regularly work with AVR and ARM-based microcontrollers using C/C++, and build scalable backends with Quarkus and PostgreSQL. On the frontend, I use Angular for building modern dashboards and responsive apps.

🌐 I’m the developer behind meintennisplatz.de, a full-stack application for managing tennis court reservations, built with Angular and a Quarkus backend. The platform features real-time data, secure authentication, and a clean modular architecture.
I have deep experience with Quarkus, including REST APIs, JWT security, PostgreSQL integration, native builds, and Docker deployment.

📱 I’m also building an iOS app with SwiftUI, designed to control and visualize LoRaWAN and WiFi-connected sensor data. It integrates Apple Sign-In, HMAC-authenticated APIs, and automation rules for edge devices.

📡 My current work includes:
* A smart gardening system with LoRaWAN (via Helium), ultra-low-power design and sensor automation.
* Real-time data visualization and control via web and mobile apps.
* Secure and automated deployments using Docker, GitHub Actions, Traefik, and Cloudflare.

💡 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in:
* Energy-efficient sensor systems based on ARM microcontrollers
* Secure backend development with Java & Quarkus, using HMAC-authenticated endpoints and OpenID Connect
* CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration

🧠 Programming languages I use: **Java, C, C++, TypeScript, Swift, Python** *— plus Bash and for platform-specific tooling.*

🔐 I’m passionate about clean architecture, secure full-stack communication, and building systems that reliably bridge embedded hardware and cloud infrastructure.
